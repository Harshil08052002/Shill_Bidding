🛡️ Detecting Shill Bidding in Online Auctions
A Predictive Model Approach | Business Analytics

📌 Project Overview
Shill bidding is a form of auction fraud where sellers place fake bids to inflate prices, misleading genuine buyers. This project aims to detect and prevent shill bidding using predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms.

🎯 Objectives
✔ Identify fraudulent bidding patterns in online auctions
✔ Build machine learning models to classify shill bidding behavior
✔ Enhance trust and transparency in online auction platforms

Programming: Python 🐍
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, k-NN, Boosted Trees, Naïve Bayes
📊 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Size: 6,321 bids | Features: 13
Target Variable: Binary classification (Shill vs. Legitimate bids)
🔍 Key Findings
Boosted Trees achieved 100% precision and recall, making it the most effective model
Random Forest and Logistic Regression also performed well with high accuracy
Data exploration revealed distinct patterns in bidding behavior that indicate fraud
